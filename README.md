# text-adventure-game
Text based adventure game used for year 9 coursework.

Currently running on: http://rosiekwatson.co.uk/

### Disclaimers:
- Stylesheet has been kept in HTML as this is the format required for the project.
- ES5 style functions as this is the format they are being taught.
- There are a few minor mistakes left in (such as input box not clearing) to allow the students to improve upon this design.

## Todo:
- [X] Break into functions
- [X] Do comments
- [X] 3 questions
- [ ] Improve sneak option?
- [x] Change all to old function layout
- [x] Change fieldsets to divs

### programming constructs
- [x] Remove nesting of if statements
- [x] Loops (while and for) - maybe for incorrect answer, maybe another for level uppping, maybe for checking health levels
- [x] Use comparisons (and ands and ors)
- [x] Data structures: change objects to arrays

### Ideas
- [ ] Maybe use it as the 3rd option
- [ ] Split out optional CSS so it looks less cluttered
- [ ] Maybe have a function per round to make it simpler and also make loop usage easier?
