# text-adventure-game
Text based adventure game used for year 9 coursework.

Currently running on: http://rosiekwatson.co.uk/

### Disclaimers:
- Stylesheet has been kept in HTML as this is the format required for the project.
- ES5 style functions as this is the format they are being taught.

## Todo:
- Break into functions
- Fix clearing of input
- Do comments
- 3 questions, looping if they get it wrong
- More options than just sneak (think of what else it could do)
- Change all to old function layout


### programming constructs
- Remove nesting of if statements
- Loops (while and for) - maybe for incorrect answer, maybe another for level uppping, maybe for checking health levels
- Use comparisons (and ands and ors)
- Data structures: change objects to arrays
